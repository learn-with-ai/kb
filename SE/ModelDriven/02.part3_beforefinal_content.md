## summary

- The chapter discusses the architecture development in Model Driven Software Development (MDSD), focusing on the use of UML profiles and generative software architecture to enhance development efficiency, quality, and reusability.
- It highlights the importance of redundancy avoidance in software architectures and how generative software architectures can delegate redundancy to increase productivity.
- The text explains the process of creating a UML profile for formal MDSD models, including the use of stereotypes and tagged values for domain-specific requirements.
- Transformations from model to code are discussed, emphasizing the limitations of XSLT and the benefits of using frameworks like openArchitectureWare for metaprogramming.
- The chapter details the implementation of a metamodel in Java for the generator framework, including the representation of stereotypes and the handling of tagged values and service methods for generation.
- Template programming is introduced as a method for generating platform-specific implementation skeletons, with examples provided for generating deployment descriptors.
- The mode of operation of the MDSD generator is explained, including the roles of the design language, UML design, XMI input, metamodel implementation, templates, and the generator backend.
- Practical implementation opportunities are flagged, such as the creation of a UML profile and the use of the openArchitectureWare framework for code generation.
- The chapter includes important images, such as Figure 3.7 showing an architecture-centric design for UserRegistration and Figure 3.8 depicting a UML profile definition for the design language.
- Real-world applications and use cases are mentioned, including the car-sharing application and an insurance application as examples of software systems that could benefit from the same technological principles.
- The final takeaway emphasizes the pivotal role of metamodels in MDSD and directs readers to Chapter 6 for a deeper dive into the topic.
- The chapter discusses the necessity of a bootstrapping process in MDSD to initially create metamodels, templates, and profiles, emphasizing the importance of starting with a handmade code blueprint.
- It highlights how changes and extensions to the generative software architecture can be efficiently managed by adapting templates and regenerating code, reducing manual adaptations.
- The text explains the concept of protected regions in MDSD generators, which allow for the preservation of manually-developed business logic during regeneration.
- The importance of structuring metaprograms in MDSD is discussed, advocating for mechanisms like object-orientation to manage the growth of metaprograms iteratively and incrementally.
- The chapter addresses skepticism towards the OMG-MDA approach, advocating for the practical value of architecture-centric MDSD and the need for better tool support.
- It introduces the concept of domain in MDSD, explaining how domains can be broken down into technical subdomains and partitions for specialized modeling.
- The role of metamodels in formalizing the structure of a domain is detailed, along with the importance of meta meta models in defining the language for metamodeling.
- The distinction between abstract and concrete syntax in modeling languages is explained, with examples from XML and UML to illustrate the concept.
- Practical implementation opportunities are flagged, such as the adaptation of templates for changes in architectural aspects and the use of protected regions for business logic.
- The chapter includes important insights into the process of concept formation in MDSD, aiming to create a unified terminology and conceptual superstructure.
- Real-world applications and use cases are mentioned, including the adaptation of descriptor files for different application servers and the extension of the generative software architecture for new requirements.
- The final takeaway emphasizes the importance of a unified MDSD terminology and the role of metamodels and meta meta models in the development of modeling languages.
- The chapter delves into the static semantics of languages, emphasizing their role in determining well-formedness criteria, such as variable declaration rules in programming languages.
- It highlights the use of UML profiles and OCL expressions for defining static semantics in MDSD, underlining their importance in detecting modeling errors.
- Domain-Specific Languages (DSL) are introduced as tools for formally expressing key domain aspects, requiring a metamodel, static semantics, and concrete syntax for effective modeling.
- The distinction between modeling language and DSL is clarified, with a preference for DSL due to its domain-specific context emphasis.
- Examples of formal models in MDSD are provided, including architecture-centric designs and Java programs, illustrating the importance of domain context.
- The concept of platforms in MDSD is explored, detailing their role in supporting domain realization and the transformation of formal models.
- Transformations in MDSD are categorized into model-to-model and model-to-platform transformations, with examples given to illustrate their applications.
- Platform-specific idioms are discussed as a powerful tool in model-to-platform transformations, enabling transparent pattern application.
- The product in MDSD is defined as the outcome of transformations, which can include generated and non-generated artifacts.
- Software system families and product lines are introduced as concepts that leverage domain architecture for creating varied products.
- The Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) is positioned within MDSD, noting its use of MOF as a meta meta model and its focus on UML profiles for DSLs.
- Architecture-Centric MDSD (AC-MDSD) is highlighted as a key focus of the book, with its terminology and concepts classified within the broader MDSD context.
