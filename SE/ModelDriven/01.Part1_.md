- The goals of MDSD are outlined, including increased development speed, enhanced software quality, improved maintainability, and the manageability of complexity through abstraction.
- The MDSD approach is explained, focusing on the use of formal and abstract models, domain-specific modeling languages (DSLs), and the role of semantically rich platforms in simplifying code generation.
- The basic terminology of the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) standard is introduced, including Platform-Independent Models (PIMs), Platform-Specific Models (PSMs), and the process of model transformation.
- The concept of UML profiles is detailed, explaining how they extend the UML vocabulary to define formal modeling languages tailored to specific domains.
- The relationship between metamodels and profiles is clarified, illustrating how UML profiles supplement standard UML concepts with domain-specific ones, such as in the example of an EJB profile.
- The chapter underscores the importance of formal semantics in MDA models, distinguishing them from common UML models by their clearly defined transformations to target platforms.
- The discussion on platforms within the MDA context highlights their varying abstraction levels and the potential for platforms to build upon each other, emphasizing the flexibility of MDSD.
- Practical implications of MDSD are considered, including the potential for interoperability and portability through standardization, as well as the challenges of adopting MDSD in practice.
- The chapter concludes by setting the stage for deeper exploration of MDSD concepts in subsequent chapters, particularly focusing on metamodeling and the construction of domain architectures.
- The chapter delves into Architecture-Centric Model-Driven Software Development (AC-MDSD), emphasizing its focus on increasing development efficiency, software quality, and reusability by automating the generation of infrastructure code.
- A historical perspective is provided, comparing the evolution of software development practices and highlighting the shift towards more automated and architecture-centric approaches.
- The concept of generative software architectures is introduced, explaining how they encapsulate architectural schemata in software form to automate the generation of infrastructure code based on domain models.
- The role of UML profiles in AC-MDSD is detailed, illustrating how they formalize architecture-centric design languages for creating Platform-Independent Models (PIMs) that abstract from technological details.
- The chapter contrasts AC-MDSD with the OMG's MDA vision, noting AC-MDSD's preference for forward engineering and its avoidance of explicitly visible Platform-Specific Models (PSMs) to simplify development and avoid consistency issues.
