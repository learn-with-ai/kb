## summary

- The chapter discusses the architecture development aspect of Model Driven Software Development (MDSD), focusing on the creation of a generative software architecture that automates application development based on models.
- Redundancy avoidance is highlighted as a key concept, aiming to delegate redundancy into a generative software architecture to increase application development productivity.
- The UML profile is introduced as a means to create formal MDSD models, with examples provided on how stereotypes and tagged values extend standard UML for domain-specific requirements.
- Transformations from model to code are explored, noting the limitations of XSLT and introducing the openArchitectureWare framework as a solution for metaprogramming in the context of generative software architecture.
- Template programming is detailed as a method for generating platform-specific implementation skeletons, with examples showing how templates combine static text with properties from the metamodel.
- The mode of operation of the MDSD generator within the openArchitectureWare framework is explained, detailing components like the design language, UML design, XMI input, metamodel implementation, templates, and generator backend.
- Practical implementation opportunities include the creation of a UML profile for specific project requirements and the use of the openArchitectureWare framework for code generation.
- The chapter provides insights into the benefits of MDSD, such as enhanced development efficiency, quality, maintainability, and reusability, while also acknowledging the trade-offs in platform independence.
- Images and diagrams in the chapter, such as Figure 3.7 and Figure 3.8, illustrate architecture-centric design and UML profile definitions, enhancing understanding of the concepts discussed.
- The final takeaway emphasizes the importance of metamodels in MDSD and previews a deeper exploration in Chapter 6.
- The chapter discusses the architecture development in Model-Driven Software Development (MDSD), emphasizing the dependency of generated code on the platform.
- Bootstrapping is introduced as a necessary process to create initial metamodels, templates, and profiles, suggesting the development of a 'handmade' code blueprint first.
- Adaptations to the generative software architecture are highlighted, showing how changes in requirements or platforms can be efficiently managed through template adjustments.
- The boundary between infrastructure code and manually-developed business logic is explored, with protected regions introduced as a method to preserve business logic during regeneration.
- Structuring metaprograms is discussed, advocating for mechanisms like object-orientation to manage the growth of MDSD transformations.
- The conclusion reflects on the practicality of MDSD, addressing skepticism and emphasizing the importance of tool support for successful implementation.
- Concept formation in MDSD is introduced, aiming to establish a unified terminology and conceptual superstructure for the field.
- The domain is defined as the starting point in MDSD, with subdomains categorized into technical and content increments.
- Metamodels are described as formalizations of a domain's structure, essential for automation in MDSD.
- The meta meta model's role in defining the language for metamodeling and its importance for tool integration is explained.
- Abstract and concrete syntax in modeling languages are differentiated, with examples provided from XML and UML.
- Practical implementation opportunities include the development of templates based on handmade code and the use of protected regions for business logic.
- Real-world applications include adapting to new versions of EJB or Struts and migrating between application servers like JBoss and Bea Weblogic.
- Important images or descriptions mentioned include Figure 3.11 (Extended EntityObject User) and Figure 3.12 (Profile definition with constraints).
- Static semantics of a language determine its criteria for well-formedness, such as the rule that variables must be declared, which is not recognized by the parser but by the compiler’s static analysis.
- Domain-Specific Languages (DSL) make key aspects of a domain formally expressable and modelable, requiring a metamodel, static semantics, and concrete syntax, with semantics crucial for modelers and automatic transformations.
- Formal models in MDSD are starting points for automated transformations, requiring a DSL and being formulated in the DSL’s concrete syntax, thus obtaining meaning from the DSL’s semantics.
- Platforms in MDSD support the realization of the domain by simplifying the transformation of formal models, with examples including J2EE with Apache Struts and helper classes.
- Transformations in MDSD are based on a source metamodel, distinguishing between model-to-model and model-to-platform transformations, with the latter often called model-to-code transformation.
- Platform-specific idioms (Platform Idioms) are powerful tools for model-to-platform transformations, allowing patterns like Business Delegate to be applied transparently.
- The product in MDSD is created through transformations, aggregating the platform, generated, and sometimes non-generated artifacts like manually-programmed business logic.
- Domain architecture is central to MDSD, determining supported concepts and their mapping to a platform, with the platform acting as the runtime system.
- Software system families consist of all products that can be created with a certain domain architecture, requiring the architecture to be flexible enough to express variabilities between products.
- Product lines are sets of complementary single products, which may or may not share technical commonalities, and can be based on software system families.
- MDA is a specialization of MDSD, using MOF as its meta meta model and expecting DSLs to be based on MOF, with UML profiles recommended as concrete syntax.
- Executable UML models are a main objective of MDA, being directly executable on a powerful platform, with action semantics allowing the specification of algorithms in an abstract form.
- Architecture-Centric MDSD (AC-MDSD) focuses on generative architecture, design languages, and architecture-centric meta models, with transformations targeting platforms and generating artifacts like code snippets and skeletons.
