## summary

- MDSD provides a safeguard against creating 'big ball of mud' systems by structuring code integration and development processes.
- In MDSD, artifacts serve as formal documentation, ensuring synchronization between documentation and code, unlike in classical software development where documentation often falls out of sync.
- The quality of generated code in MDSD depends on the transformations and reference implementation, challenging the prejudice against generated code's readability and performance.
- MDSD reduces the test effort and potential sources of errors through automation and the generalization of schematic code, improving the software's error rate.
- Reuse is a significant advantage of MDSD, with domain architectures enabling the reuse of DSLs, platforms, and transformations across similar software systems.
- MDSD enhances portability and changeability through fan-out, allowing multiple artifacts and implementations to be generated from a single model over time.
- Investment in MDSD involves training and infrastructure but can lead to significant benefits, including reduced programming effort and increased maintainability.
- Architecture-centric MDSD is recommended for initial adoption due to its lower investment and quick payoff, even within a six-month project.
- Functional/professional MDSD domains extend the benefits of MDSD by applying the paradigm to functional domains, further reducing modeling and coding efforts.
- The development of functional domain-specific languages and frameworks is an incremental process that builds on architecture-centric MDSD, requiring careful consideration of domain boundaries and complexity.
- Important images include graphical representations of code-volume distribution and the ratio of generated to manually created sources, illustrating the efficiency gains of MDSD.
- MDSD requires significant domain experience for the development of functional domain-specific languages and frameworks, suggesting it should not be attempted in initial projects.
- Existing functional frameworks can serve as the foundation for MDSD platforms, improving productivity with relatively little investment.
- Prejudices against MDSD often stem from past experiences with CASE tools, but modern MDSD tools offer flexibility and modular transformations that address these concerns.
- MDSD's benefits include improved performance and readability of application source code, leveraging manually-created reference implementations optimized by experienced team members.
- Modern MDSD tools, unlike UML-based IDEs with round-trip support, offer higher abstraction levels and the advantages of generative techniques.
- MDSD does not create strong dependencies on specific tools or technology combinations, thanks to modular transformations and the treatment of model transformations as first-class artifacts.
- The iterative, dual-track process of MDSD contrasts with traditional waterfall methods, aligning well with agile methodologies and test-driven approaches.
- MDSD ensures model and code consistency by separating generated and non-generated code, with rules for collaboration defined based on project requirements.
- The development of generators or transformations in MDSD is cost-effective, with the effort for generalization being a fraction of that for manual reference implementation coding.
- Organizational aspects of MDSD highlight the distinction between application development and domain architecture development, emphasizing the need for specialized roles and knowledge.
- Key roles in domain architecture development include domain experts, domain analysts, language designers, and various types of domain architects, each contributing to the MDSD process.
- MDSD is scalable and suitable for distributed project environments, including offshoring, with specific roles and knowledge distribution enhancing project success.
- The coordination between domain analysis and domain architecture teams is crucial, with roles potentially overlapping to ensure project success.
- Application development in MDSD delegates critical activities to domain architecture development, reducing time pressure and improving quality.
- Team structure in MDSD projects should be flexible, adapting to the team's knowledge and preferences, with a clear separation between domain architecture and application development.
- Scaling role assignments in MDSD projects is essential, with domain architects needing to coach application developers and provide feedback on the domain architecture.
- Cross-cutting teams, especially the architecture group, play a pivotal role in maintaining standards and continuous improvement in large-scale MDSD projects.
- Software product development models vary, with in-house development offering consolidation of domain knowledge but facing high staff costs.
- Classical outsourcing and offshoring present cost advantages but come with risks such as knowledge loss and communication challenges.
- MDSD can mitigate some risks in distributed software development, especially in offshoring, by standardizing processes and improving communication.
- Radical offshoring maximizes cost advantages but requires significant knowledge transfer and travel expenses, with MDSD benefits accruing to the offshore partner.
- The architecture group's role as a service provider and 'keeper of the software production line' is vital for the success of MDSD projects.
- Product rationalization and software mass production are goals of MDSD in the context of functional domain-specific platforms, aiming for efficiency and scalability.
- Radical offshoring presents significant risks, including knowledge transfer challenges and dependency on offshore partners, making it a risky model unless time-to-market is not critical.
- Controlled offshoring mitigates risks by keeping domain expertise and technical knowledge within the organization, leveraging MDSD for formal specifications and architectural frameworks.
- Component-wise decision-making in product development emphasizes the importance of a clear-cut component architecture for strategic build/buy/open source decisions.
- MDSD piloting requires careful project selection, team acceptance, and the right development environment to ensure success.
- Risk analysis for MDSD adoption highlights the flexibility to revert to traditional methods if needed, with minimal loss of invested effort.
- Project initialization for MDSD involves team familiarization with MDSD basics, starting with architecture-centric MDSD, and dynamic role balancing.
- Adapting existing systems to MDSD involves refactoring and remodeling, with a focus on integrating legacy applications into the MDSD framework.
- Classifying software inventory into strategic, non-strategic, and legacy assets is crucial for long-term MDSD adoption and business-wide strategy integration.
- Strategic software assets are key to competitive advantage, requiring a clear business strategy and articulation of software requirements for identification.
- MDSD offers significant advantages in software maintenance and evolution, enabling easier integration of architectural changes across the code base.
- The text presents a complete QVT Relations example for transforming an Alma model to a database model, illustrating key concepts in model-driven software development.
