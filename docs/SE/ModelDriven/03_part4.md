## summary

- AC-MDSD is a specialization of MDSD that overlaps with MDA, focusing on architecturally motivated domains and single-step model-to-code transformations.
- Generative Programming (GP) is defined as a software engineering paradigm based on modeling software system families for automated product generation.
- GP emphasizes industrial production paradigms, aiming for 100% automation and optimized products from formal requirements specifications.
- The domain model of GP includes problem space (requirements) and solution space (implementation), connected by configuration knowledge.
- Software Factories, coined by Microsoft, aim to industrialize software development by configuring IDEs for specific application domains with DSLs and frameworks.
- The Software Factory Schema defines necessary viewpoints for building a system, while the Software Factory Template configures the IDE for development.
- Model-Integrated Computing (MIC) focuses on using DSLs for distributed realtime and embedded systems, with models central to the system lifecycle.
- Language-Oriented Programming, exemplified by JetBrains' MPS, involves defining domain-specific languages with integrated editor and compiler support.
- Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) emphasizes creating models in a DSL suitable for the domain, with generation techniques becoming more prevalent.
- MDSD contrasts with CASE and 4GL tools by rejecting 'one size fits all' approaches, focusing instead on development methodology and domain-specific architectures.
- Important images include the domain model of Generative Programming and the classification of GP concepts in the context of MDSD.
- Roundtrip engineering allows bidirectional changes between model and code, but MDSD models are more abstract, making automatic consistency after manual code changes impossible.
- Methods to avoid manual changes in generated code include abstraction, tagging the model, separation of code classes, and tagging the code, listed in descending order of elegance.
- Patterns in MDSD are formalized best practices, with transformations often creating structures in the target model that correspond to pattern solutions.
- Pattern languages can serve as a source for DSLs by identifying key concepts and configuration alternatives needed for system description and generation.
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) shares with MDSD the goal of creating high-quality domain models, though DDD does not use DSLs or code generation.
- Data-driven development and MDSD both use metamodels for domain conceptualization, with MDSD generating application artifacts before runtime and data-driven approaches customizing systems dynamically at runtime.
- MDSD supports agile software development by enabling iterative-incremental processes and focusing on runnable software for stakeholder validation.
- The Agile Manifesto's principles align with MDSD, emphasizing individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.
- Agile techniques like pair programming and test-driven development are compatible with MDSD, with models serving as a central artifact for development.
- MDSD can scale agile techniques by codifying architecture and domain knowledge, separating domain architecture from application development.
- Metamodeling is central to MDSD, defining the abstract syntax and static semantics of DSLs, enabling model validation, transformations, and tool integration.
- The OMG's four metalevels (M0-M3) structure the relationship between real-world instances, models, metamodels, and the meta-metamodel (MOF), with UML as an instance of MOF.
- Metamodels and models have a class-instance relationship, where each model is an instance of a metamodel, and metamodels are defined using a metamodeling language.
- UML can be extended in three ways: through the MOF-based metamodel extension, using stereotypes/profiles in UML 1.x, and using the enhanced profile mechanism in UML 2.0.
- Extension based on the UML's formal metamodel involves creating new M2 classes that inherit from UML metaclasses, allowing for the definition of new language constructs.
- UML 1.x stereotypes allow for the specialization of UML metaclasses without MOF, with limitations like untyped tagged values and no new meta associations.
- UML 2.0 enhances the stereotype mechanism with extensions, allowing typed tagged values and multiple stereotypes per model element, formalized in the UML metamodel.
- UML profiles, consisting of stereotypes, tagged values, and constraints, adapt UML to specific domains, with UML 2.0 formally defining the profile concept based on the UML metamodel.
- The distinction between metalevels and levels of abstraction is crucial, with models at the same metalevel able to differ in abstraction, linked through transformations.
- Practical UML extensions often use stereotypes/profiles due to tool support, despite the theoretical flexibility of MOF-based metamodel extensions.
- UML profiles allow for the extension and specialization of UML for specific domains, with stereotypes, tagged values, and constraints forming their core components.
- The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is crucial for defining precise constraints in models and metamodels, enhancing model validation and tool-processability.
- Feature models serve as an example of domain-specific metamodeling, illustrating the importance of suitable graphical notations for model readability and creation.
- Component-based systems demonstrate practical metamodeling, where components and their interactions are defined through a metamodel, facilitating architecture-centric development.
- Tool support for metamodeling varies, with options ranging from no support in standard UML tools to integrated metamodeling tools that adapt interfaces based on the metamodel.
- Model validation can be achieved through separate tools like openArchitectureWare, which parse models, instantiate them against a metamodel, and validate constraints.
- The integration of metamodels with development tools is essential for effective domain-specific modeling, enabling model validation, transformation, and code generation.
- Examples of metamodeling, such as feature models and component-based systems, highlight the practical applications and benefits of formal metamodel definitions.
- The use of OCL in metamodeling ensures that constraints are formally defined and can be automatically validated, improving the precision and reliability of models.
- The chapter underscores the significance of metamodeling in MDSD, providing a foundation for creating domain-specific languages and tools that support the development process.
- Metamodeling extends UML for specific domains, with examples showing how to define constraints and behaviors within models.
- The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is used for precise model validation, ensuring attributes and operations meet specified criteria.
- Component-based systems illustrate practical metamodeling, where components, ports, and interfaces are defined and validated against a metamodel.
- Physical quantities in the ALMA telescope project demonstrate specialized ValueTypes with units and value ranges, integrated into the metamodel.
- Pitfalls in metamodeling include incorrect use of interfaces and dependencies, highlighting the importance of accurate UML notation.
- The ALMA project showcases complex metamodeling, generating multiple artifact types from UML models to meet diverse subsystem requirements.
- Tool-supported model validation, like in openArchitectureWare, involves Java-based constraint checks against the metamodel for consistency.
- Behavior modeling within metamodels can implicitly define architecture guidelines, reducing manual coding for common operations.
- Specialized attributes, such as bounded and enum attributes, enforce value constraints directly within the metamodel.
- Correct and incorrect solutions to common metamodeling problems provide practical guidance for effective model-driven development.
- Correct metamodeling practices emphasize the importance of accurately defining constraints, such as ensuring entities have exactly one attribute of a specific type, like EntityPK.
- The misuse of tagged values instead of proper metamodel associations is highlighted as a common pitfall in defining attributes and primary keys within models.
- The instanceof relationship in UML is clarified, distinguishing between language constructs and metalevel instances to avoid confusion in model representation.
- Examples demonstrate the correct and incorrect ways to model dependencies and interfaces, stressing the need for precise UML notation to convey intended model semantics.
- The section underscores the complexity of metamodeling with UML, offering guidance to navigate common pitfalls and ensure accurate model definitions.
