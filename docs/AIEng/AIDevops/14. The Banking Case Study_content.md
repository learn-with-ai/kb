## summary

- Customer churn in banking refers to customers ending their relationship with a bank, impacting revenue and increasing acquisition costs.
- ML algorithms analyze transaction history and behavioral patterns to predict churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.
- Automation in the ML lifecycle is crucial for rapid iteration and deployment, keeping models responsive to evolving data and business needs.
- Traditional churn analysis lacks flexibility, leading to false positives and unnecessary incentives, potentially provoking negative reactions.
- Churn prediction is a binary classification problem, with features including demographics, transaction history, and product usage.
- Pretrained foundation models can provide deeper insights into spending behaviors, enhancing churn prediction accuracy.
- Model calibration is essential for reliable probabilities, ensuring fairness and mitigating biases in predictions.
- Batch predictions are used in marketing campaigns, with personalized offers distributed via various channels based on customer behavior.
- Data sourcing and validation are foundational steps, requiring accurate data from core banking systems and CRM platforms.
- Feature engineering balances performance, cost, explainability, and fairness, with feature stores facilitating cross-team collaboration.
- Model training involves version control and distributed training techniques to handle large datasets efficiently.
