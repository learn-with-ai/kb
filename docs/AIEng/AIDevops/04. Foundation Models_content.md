## summary

- Foundation Models (FMs) are advanced ML models trained on massive datasets for general purposes, capable of being fine-tuned for specific tasks.
- The size of FMs can be measured by the number of parameters, documents used for training, and the dimensionality of vector spaces they manage.
- Transformer architecture is pivotal for FMs, utilizing vector spaces and attention mechanisms to process and understand input data contextually.
- Alternatives to transformer architecture in FMs include CNNs, RNNs, hybrid models, GNNs, and autoencoders, each suited for different data types and tasks.
- Customizing FMs involves techniques like prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), fine-tuning, and distilling, alongside the use of guardrails for monitoring.
- Prompt engineering is a critical skill for interacting with FMs, involving the crafting of inputs to guide the model's outputs effectively.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances FMs by integrating external information retrieval, improving accuracy and relevance of outputs.
- The chapter highlights the importance of understanding and applying various customization techniques to leverage FMs effectively in AI-based systems.
- Images in the book illustrate the processes of prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation, showing how data sources and user inputs are integrated to enhance FM outputs.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances FMs by integrating external data, but poses challenges in ensuring data relevance and security.
- Fine-tuning FMs involves adjusting model parameters with domain-specific data, with options for full fine-tuning or parameter-efficient techniques like LoRA.
- Distilling FMs transfers knowledge from a large 'teacher' model to a smaller 'student' model, optimizing for efficiency and performance.
- Guardrails are mechanisms to monitor and control FM inputs and outputs, ensuring compliance with ethical, legal, and functional requirements.
- FhGenie exemplifies an FM-based system designed for privacy and accessibility, showcasing practical implementation and ongoing development challenges.
- The chapter discusses the importance of choosing between narrow ML models and FMs based on cost, data availability, and system requirements.
- Cost considerations for AI systems include tool, development, maintenance, and operation expenses, with FMs offering scalability over narrow ML models.
- Images in the book illustrate the architectural differences between narrow model-based and foundation model-based systems, highlighting the evolution towards more versatile AI solutions.
- The chapter discusses the operational and maintenance costs associated with narrow ML models versus Foundation Models (FMs), highlighting the cost advantages of narrow ML models due to lower cloud hosting and operational expenses.
- It explores the decision-making process for choosing between external FMs, in-house FMs, or open-weight FMs, emphasizing factors like control, privacy, and cost.
- A data cleaning experiment with ChatGPT demonstrates the sophisticated capabilities of FMs beyond textual or image analysis, suggesting their potential in various application areas.
- Organizational maturity is identified as a critical factor in effectively utilizing FMs, with a diagram illustrating the progression from prompt engineering to creating bespoke FMs based on maturity levels.
- The inherent challenges of FMs, such as limited grounding and hallucination (or confabulation), are discussed, underscoring the limitations in their reliability and accuracy.
- The summary reiterates the versatility of FMs in performing a wide range of tasks through customization techniques like prompt engineering and RAG, while also noting the importance of considering cost and organizational maturity.
- Discussion questions and further reading suggestions are provided to encourage deeper exploration of the topics covered in the chapter.
- The provided diagram illustrates the relationship between a company's maturity and their use of foundation models, showing how organizational maturity influences the adoption and customization of FMs.
